# jumpcutter
This project is a .NET fork of carykh/jumpcutter

Automatically edits videos. Explanation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ8orIurGxw

## Project Info:
This is being re-written to work with .net, at same same time updating features

## Main Goals:
* Show a detailed progress and percent for file processing 
* Improving processing time and take advantage of multi-threadded CPUs
* Support conversion of videos longer than 1:30hs
* Process images in memory, rather than creating 100000+ of image files on disk
* Run multiple instances at once

## Some other things I'm intrested in:
Running as a service to pickup files from a directory
Live jumpcutting on youtube videos
